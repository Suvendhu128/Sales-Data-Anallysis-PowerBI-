# Sales Data Aanlysis

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what I achieved in this project:
Data Loading & Analysis: Imported sales data from an Excel file containing five worksheets into MySQL for detailed analysis.
Seamless Integration: Connected MySQL to Power BI to visualize key metrics.

Visual Highlights:
Highest Sales Revenue: Identified and showcased top-performing products.
Month-Year Revenue Trend: Analyzed and visualized revenue trends over time.
Top Customers: Highlighted our most valuable customers.
Location Data Visualization: Mapped out sales distribution across different regions.
Responsive Design: Enhanced the dashboard with a mobile view for on-the-go accessibility and republished it.
